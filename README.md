AraguaneyBits MultiWallet
===============

Our objective is to support all cryptocurrencies of Venezuelan origin that have an active development team. To have all the Venezuelan cryptocurrencies stored through a single application, without sacrificing security. Private keys are stored in your own device. Instead of having a backup file for each coin, you get a master key that can be memorized or stored on a sheet of paper. Restore all the portfolios of a single recovery phrase.
